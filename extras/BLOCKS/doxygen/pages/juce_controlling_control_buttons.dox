/**
@page controlling_control_buttons Controlling control buttons

In addition to sending button pressed and button released events, ControlButton objects can allow your application code to change the color of the LED behind the corresponding physical button on a BLOCKS device.

An array of pointers to the available %ControlButton objects can be obtained from the Block::getButtons method of a Block---see the @ref discovering_blocks section for details of how to obtain a %Block object.
Once you have a %ControlButton, the functions involving the LED are ControlButton::hasLight and ControlButton::setLightColor, which are descriptively named.
A code snippet showing how to turn all the available buttons of a %Block red is shown below.
@code{.cpp}
void setAllButtonsRed (Block& block)
{
    for (auto button : block->getButtons())
        if (button->hasLight())
            button->setLightColor (Colors::red);
}
@endcode
